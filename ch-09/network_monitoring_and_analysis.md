# Chapter 9: Network Monitoring and Analysis

## 1. tcpdump and Wireshark
- Introduction to packet capture and analysis
- Using tcpdump for command-line packet capture
- Wireshark for GUI-based packet analysis
- Practical examples and use cases

## 2. syslog and journald
- Overview of system logging in Linux
- Configuring and using syslog
- Introduction to systemd's journald
- Analyzing logs for network-related issues

## 3. eBPF for network observability
- Introduction to eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter)
- eBPF tools for network monitoring
- Writing custom eBPF programs for network analysis
- Performance considerations and use cases

## 4. Netflow and sFlow
- Understanding flow-based network monitoring
- Netflow: configuration, collection, and analysis
- sFlow: sampling techniques and implementation
- Comparing Netflow and sFlow for different scenarios

## Practical Exercises
1. Capture and analyze network traffic using tcpdump and Wireshark
2. Set up centralized logging with syslog and analyze network logs
3. Develop a simple eBPF program for network monitoring
4. Configure Netflow or sFlow on a network device and analyze the data
