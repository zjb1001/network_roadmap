# ch-01 Foundational Knowledge for Linux Network Stack

Before proceeding, ensure you have the necessary packages installed:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y gcc make
```


## 1. Basic Networking Concepts

### OSI Model

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used to describe how data communication occurs in a network. It consists of seven layers:

1. Physical Layer
2. Data Link Layer
3. Network Layer
4. Transport Layer
5. Session Layer
6. Presentation Layer
7. Application Layer

Each layer has specific functions and protocols associated with it. Understanding the OSI model is crucial for grasping how network communication works at different levels.

### TCP/IP Model

The TCP/IP model is a more practical, simplified version of the OSI model. It consists of four layers:

1. Network Interface Layer (equivalent to OSI Physical and Data Link layers)
2. Internet Layer (equivalent to OSI Network layer)
3. Transport Layer (equivalent to OSI Transport layer)
4. Application Layer (equivalent to OSI Session, Presentation, and Application layers)

The TCP/IP model is the foundation of modern internet communication.

## 2. Linux Fundamentals

To work effectively with the Linux network stack, a solid understanding of Linux basics is essential:

- File system hierarchy
- Command-line interface (CLI) usage
- Process management
- User and group permissions
- Package management (e.g., apt, yum)
- Shell scripting basics

## 3. C Programming Language

C is the primary language used in the Linux kernel, including the network stack. Key concepts to master include:

- Pointers and memory management
- Structures and unions
- Function pointers
- Bitwise operations
- File I/O
- Network programming basics (sockets, etc.)

## Practical Exercises

To reinforce these foundational concepts, consider the following exercises:

1. Set up a virtual machine with a Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu Server).
2. Practice basic networking commands (ping, traceroute, netstat, ss).
3. Write a simple C program that uses sockets to communicate between two processes.
4. Analyze network traffic using tools like Wireshark or tcpdump.

By mastering these foundational topics, you'll be well-prepared to dive deeper into the Linux network stack in subsequent chapters.
