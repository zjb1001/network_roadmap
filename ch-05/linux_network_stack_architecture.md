# Chapter 5: Linux Network Stack Architecture

This chapter explores the internal architecture of the Linux network stack, focusing on key components and their interactions.

## 1. Network Device Drivers

Network device drivers are the software interfaces between the kernel and network hardware. They handle:
- Hardware initialization and configuration
- Packet transmission and reception
- Interrupt handling
- Buffer management

## 2. Network Device Interfaces

Network device interfaces provide a standardized way for the kernel to interact with different network devices. Key concepts include:
- Interface naming (e.g., eth0, wlan0)
- Interface statistics
- Interface flags and properties

## 3. Protocol Handlers

Protocol handlers process incoming packets based on their protocol type. They include:
- IP protocol handler
- TCP protocol handler
- UDP protocol handler
- ICMP protocol handler

## 4. Netfilter Hooks

Netfilter is the packet filtering framework in Linux. It provides hooks at various points in the network stack, allowing for:
- Packet filtering (iptables)
- Network Address Translation (NAT)
- Packet mangling
- Connection tracking

## Practical Exercises

1. Examine network device driver information
2. Explore network interface properties
3. Trace packet flow through protocol handlers
4. Implement a simple Netfilter module

These exercises will provide hands-on experience with the Linux network stack architecture.
